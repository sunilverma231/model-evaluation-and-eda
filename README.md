# Model Evaluation and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains projects focused on refining machine learning models and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). The aim is to improve model accuracy, understand data patterns, and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Contents

### 1. Model Evaluation and Refinement
- Techniques to assess and improve machine learning models.
- Includes train/test split, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.


### 2. Practice: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Hands-on EDA on real-world datasets.
- Visual exploration using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
- Identifying outliers, missing values, and feature relationships.

### 3. Model Evaluation and Refinement (Extended)
- Continued refinement of ML models using scikit-learn.
- Comparison of different models and parameter settings.
- Model selection based on cross-validation scores.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Goal
To build a solid foundation in understanding data deeply before modeling, and to apply rigorous evaluation techniques for reliable predictions.
